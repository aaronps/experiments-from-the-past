# Audio Loader And Mixer (AudioLAM)

This experiment in c++ from 2012, I wanted to know how the audio mixing was done, how it was stored on the wav files... so I did this.

It was fun, got to open the wav files, load the samples, mix the samples and play them through libsdl, I think it was limited to 8 bit samples... don't remember clearly.
