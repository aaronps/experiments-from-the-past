# translation-demo (2011)

This was a demo to demostrate how to use and change in realtime the translations of a SPA application.

After this demo, the technology (modified) was used in one application used as admin page for a embedded device. The requirement was that it should support at least 4 languages including Chinese, and Arabic language, I don't remember what is written in Arabic, I searched something on Internet and copied the test, hope is nothing bad.
