This is an unfinished project, I was testing [Blitzmax](http://www.blitzbasic.com/Products/blitzmax.php) but later when I wanted to buy it there were some problems when I try to pay from China with my Spanish credit card, so I just dropped it...

I found a way to reset the Blitzmax 30 days time trial both in Windows (delete a file and a registry key) and in Mac OS X(forgot how to), but it would limit me because I couldn't use Linux with it.
