# fpong (flash pong)

A simple test of flash implementing a simple pong game. The interesing part which I forgot that I did is that the computer players does actually move, I loled at this.

**NOTE** the provided compiled swf file doesn't seems to work good, I can open it moving the swf file directly to firefox but only half of the game area is visible, unfortunately I don't have flex sdk installed anymore, so no fixing.
