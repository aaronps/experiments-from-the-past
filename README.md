# picsort (2015)

My wife has thousands of photos made with iPhone, it is difficult to sort them so I made this small python tool which scan a folder and all subfolders for jpg files, copy and rename them to "yyyy-mm-dd hh-mi:ss.jpg" format in a single destination folder.

Source and destination folders has to be edited on the sourcecode.
