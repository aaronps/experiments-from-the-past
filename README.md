# The Factory Flash

This is a small game I was doing about moving boxes in a multilevel factory up and down, you control the left and right elevators, this was unfinished, the graphics are there maybe I will reuse this idea and make an android game.

Note that the good binaries are thefactory-*.swf.

The project was called pizzamaker becase this idea comes from a very old handheld game which had two screens and you would move the pizzas from bottom to top level by level... the same but I added colors to the boxes, so its not only move them up, you need to reorder them.
