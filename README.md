# interposer

Example of interposing own dynamic library over others in Linux. I think I was having some problems with [Battle for Wesnoth](https://www.wesnoth.org/) so I decided to investigate and make this mini tool for learning purposes too.

Actually it is _simple_ to do(but beware), it is in mydebug.c
