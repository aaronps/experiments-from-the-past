# My SHA1 experiment

On 2012 I was looking to add websocket support to netPanzer, for that I needed a SHA1 function but I didn't want to use a big library. After searching, it was best to just write one.

Basically just follow the steps and the calculation will be correct, I had some problems to make it right but it *might be* because the code is fucking cryptic, I used macros (check the GROK which i wished was GROG but couldn't repeat the G... and also, I was mistaken at the time... played Monkey Island so long ago.

At the end there is the function that is needed for the websocket, but I can't remember why.
